IAD Semester 3 

Note: During my process I worked with different versions of the file...These versions you can find in the folder "process"...My final result is the folder named "final-version"...In the folder "final-version" you will not see any commits... Don't be alarmed... If you wanna follow my process just go to the "process" folder where you will see many different commits for all the different versions inside (most of the commits are under "process" and then "9.main-task-final-version2").
